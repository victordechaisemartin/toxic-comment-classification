# ðŸš« Toxic Comment Classification Using Deep Learning

Harnessing the power of deep learning to foster healthier online conversations, this project aims to accurately classify and filter toxic comments from online platforms. By identifying various forms of toxicity, such as threats, obscenity, insults, and hate speech, we contribute to creating safer digital spaces.

## Overview 

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of a deep learning model capable of discerning toxic comments from benign ones. Utilizing a dataset of comments from a kaggle dataset, the model is trained to recognize patterns indicative of toxicity, thereby aiding in moderating content and enhancing online discourse.

## Features 

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementing techniques to clean and prepare textual data for analysis, ensuring optimal model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Designing and training a neural network to classify comments based on their toxicity levels.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's effectiveness in identifying toxic comments.

## Technologies Used 

- **Python**: The backbone language for developing the deep learning model and preprocessing data.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: The primary frameworks for constructing and training the neural network model.
